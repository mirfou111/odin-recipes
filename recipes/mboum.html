        <h4>Brief Description:</h4>
        <p>Poulet Yassa is a Senegalese dish made of chicken that has been marinated in a mixture of garlic, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and spices.</p>
        <p>It has become very popular throughout West Africa and in other parts of the world.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken</li>
            <li>7 onions</li>
            <li>3 lemons</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of mustard (optional)</li>
            <li>1 head of garlic</li>
            <li>1 fresh chili pepper</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the chicken. In Senegal, we usually wash it with lemon and salt to remove the strong odor.</li>
            <li>Using a food processor, blend the garlic cloves, black pepper, half of the chopped bell pepper, and the chili peppers.  
                You'll get a paste that will be used as seasoning.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken into medium-sized pieces and make incisions in each piece.</li>
            <li>Marinate the chicken with half of the seasoning paste, a generous tablespoon of mustard, 2 lemons, black pepper, a little salt, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Grill the chicken in the oven or, ideally, on a barbecue.</li>
            <li>Cut the onions into cubes or slices, as you prefer. In a pot, heat some oil. Once the oil is slightly hot, add the chopped onions.  
                Stir to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Add a bay leaf and the chili pepper.</li>
            <li>Keep an eye on the onions as they cook: when they turn translucent, add the rest of the seasoning paste, salt (not too much), and black pepper. Add the juice of a large lemon and a little water.</li>
            <li>Stir well, then let it simmer for about 30 minutes on low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the grilled chicken pieces into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve with white rice.</li>
        </ol>
